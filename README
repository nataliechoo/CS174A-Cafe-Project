# Lunar Café: CS 174A Final Demo

## Concept

The Lunar Café is a mystical place that appears in the dreams of select students, offering them a magical beverage to aid in their academic journey. Our project brings this concept to life through a choose-your-story video game experience.

## Project Overview

In this project, we:

- Created several adorable Baristas for users to interact with in a game-like fashion.
- Used magic to brew custom drinks with various effects tailored to the user's desires.
- Implemented interactive elements that allow users to admire the baristas' talents and explore the café.

## Course-Related Topics

This project incorporated several concepts learned throughout the course:

- **Transformation Matrices:** Used for both static and dynamic objects, crucial for barista animations.
- **Mobile Eye Spaces:** Provided additional views of the drink and close-ups of the rotating star.
- **Textures:** Applied textures, particularly on the drink surface, for enhanced visual appeal.
- **User Interactivity:** Created interactive elements to engage users with the game.

## Baristas and Café Design

- Baristas and café assets were created in Womp! and imported as individual shapes to allow for custom materials and transformations.
- Magical stars were created and animated, serving as a central element in the café.

## Features

### New Features

- **Text Animation:** We implemented logic to animate text, displaying it letter by letter, enhancing the visual experience.
- **Sound Integration:** We added unique sounds for various interactions, including background music, barista voices, and magical effects.
- **Animations:** We animated several elements, including barista selection, drink-making, and magical star transformations.
- **Textures & Animations:** Textures were added to objects like the drink surface, and users can inspect the drink from a bird's-eye view.

### User Interactivity

  - `x`: Go to the next text.
  - `Shift + S`: Grab the star (only when it’s at max size).
  - `i`: Inspect the drink.
